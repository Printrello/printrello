## About this tool

{{ site.title }} is a web app that takes Trello Boards and turns them into documents you can print.

## Before you begin

Before you can use {{ site.title }}, you will need to authorise the app to access your Trello account.

{{ site.title }} will be able to read all of your boards and teams; it won't be able to create and update cards, lists, boards and teams, and it won't be able to make comments for you. {{ site.title }} **never** sees your email address or your Trello password.

## Compatability

The tool has been designed to work on a modern desktop browser[^1]. It works best with Google Chrome, but other HTML5-compatible browsers might work too.

Whilst the app may work on other devices, it is recommended you use it on a desktop or laptop device.

[^1]: This app works with browsers that support the latest specification of [CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/). CSS Grid was supported in all major browsers as of October 2017, including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari. There is rudimentary support for [earlier versions of CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-css3-grid-layout-20130402/), such as the implementation shipped with IE 11, but this is not feature complete, and does not work consistently.

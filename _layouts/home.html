			<h2>About this tool</h2>
			
			<p>{{ site.title }} is a web app that takes Trello Boards and turns them into documents you can print.</p>
			
			<h2>Before you begin</h2>
			
			<p>Before you can use {{ site.title }}, you will need to authorise the app to access your Trello account.</p>
			
			<p>Your data is entirely safe - access to your boards will only work on computers you directly authorise.</p>
			
			<h2>Compatability</h2>

			<p>The tool has been designed to work on a modern desktop browser. It works best with Google Chrome, but other HTML5-compatible browsers might work too.</p>
			
			<p>Whilst the app may work on other devices, it is recommended you use it on a desktop or laptop device.</p>
			
			<h2>Source code</h2>
			
			<p>If you want to contribute to the source code from this project, you can do so on <a href="{{ site.github-repo }}" class="btn btn-primary" title="Get the source code for this app from Github">Github</a>.</p>

# Printrello

***Turn Trello boards into easily printable dashboards in a few clicks.***

## About this tool

Printrelllo is a web app that takes Trello Boards and turns them into documents you can print.

## Before you begin

Before you can use Printrelllo, you will need to authorise the app to access your Trello account.

Printrelllo will be able to read all of your boards and teams; it won't be able to create and update cards, lists, boards and teams, and it won't be able to make comments for you. Printrelllo **never** sees your email address or your Trello password.

## Compatability

The tool has been designed to work on a modern desktop browser[^1]. It works best with Google Chrome, but other HTML5-compatible browsers might work too.

Whilst the app may work on other devices, it is recommended you use it on a desktop or laptop device.

[^1]: This app works with browsers that support the latest specification of [CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/). CSS Grid was supported in all major browsers as of October 2017, including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari. There is rudimentary support for [earlier versions of CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-css3-grid-layout-20130402/), such as the implementation shipped with IE 11, but this is not feature complete, and does not work consistently.

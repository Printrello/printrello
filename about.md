# Trello Dash

<p class="lead">Trello Dash is a web app that takes Trello Boards and turns them into documents you can print.</p>

[Trello](//trello.com "Visit Trello") is a great digital tool that you can use in your projects or private life. 

But if you've ever tried to print a Trello Board, you know it **sucks**. Trello Boards print as gigantic lists, wasting loads of paper, ink and space.

This little web app was made to fix that problem for me, so I could print Trello Boards at work. I thought other people might find it useful, so I made it available on the open web: because making things open makes things better.

[You can get the source code on Github](https://github.com/johnpeart/trello-dash "Go to the Github repository"), or [get started printing Trello Boards now]({{ '/app/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }} "Get started").

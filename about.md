<p class="lead">{{ site.title }} is a web app that takes Trello Boards and turns them into documents you can print.</p>

[Trello](//trello.com "Visit Trello") is a great digital tool that you can use in your projects or private life. 

But if you've ever tried to print a Trello Board, you know it **sucks**. Trello Boards print as gigantic lists, wasting loads of paper, ink and space.

This little web app was made to fix that problem for me, so I could print Trello Boards at work. I thought other people might find it useful, so I made it available on the open web: because making things open makes things better.

The web app works best with Google Chrome on the desktop. Whilst it might work on other browsers and devices, there are no guarantees.
